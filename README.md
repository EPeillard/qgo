## qGo 

qGo is a full featured SGF editor and Go Client. It supports playing online at IGS, WING, LGS, CyberORO, Tygem, Tom and eWeiqi.

Go is an ancient Chinese board game. It's called "圍棋(Wei Qi)" in Chinese, "囲碁(Yi Go)" in Japanese, "바둑(Baduk)" in Korean.

SGF is the universial format for Go game saves.

qGo is based on Qt4. The SVN repository at Sourceforge has been inactive since 2011, so I've taken the freedom to put my bug fixes in a new repository with a more inclusive VCS.
