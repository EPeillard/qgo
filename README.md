## qGo 

qGo is a full featured SGF editor and Go Client (IGS, WING, LGS, CyberORO, Tygem, Tom and eWeiqi) based on Qt4. This repository contains the full SVN tree from Sourceforge.

Go is not the way you think, but an ancient Chinese war game which gets promoted by Japan community. It's called "圍棋(Wei Qi)" in Chinese, "囲碁(Yi Go)" in Japanese, "바둑(Baduk)" in Korean. There're still trillions of people playing Go nowadays, mostly in CJK area and among scientists, physicists, gererals and politicians in US and Europe. Playing Go is a symbol of Upper class.

SGF is the universial format for Go game saves.

This seems to be the only place still developing/porting the Qt3 qGo to Qt4. So welcome to fork/commit.
